# DiplomaDAO (*working title*)


## Overview:
A [Peer Assessment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_assessment) DAO where students will submit their project work for review by other students. 

 - The DAO will be made of students (20 students) studying the same subject/course.
 - They will all eventually submit their work for review.
 - Their work will be assessed by other students against a strict criteria.
 - In order to be awarded their diploma, a project will require a "pass" from 25% of the DAO (5 students).
 - If a project does not meet the requirements, they will be given a "fail" with feedback.
 - On passing a student will be awarded their diploma via a non-transferable NFT ie. Soulbound Token.
